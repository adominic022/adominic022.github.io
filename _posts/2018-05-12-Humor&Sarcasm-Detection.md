# Humor and Sarcasm Detection

## Sarcasm?

<em>Sarcasm<em> is a linguistic phenomenon in which  people  state  the  opposite  of  what  they  actually  mean.  
Common in literature and in spoken words, it is the use of irony to convey one's resentment or to mock. While banter is good-humored and more of a playful conversation of sorts, sarcasm is sharp: it is meant to hurt and otherwise mock with irony.

## aaaand Humor.

Humor, a qaulity of being comical and provoke laughter, refering especially to literature. Humor is evident in most people of all ages and culture, and those who respond to such interactions are known to have a <em>sense of humor<em>.

# So how does it work?

## It's pretty hard
Sarcasm is definitely on the farther end of difficulty when it comes to human expression. It's difficult for humans to understand, let alone computers. Humans are used to using tone of voice and expression, or emoticons and hashtags on social media to relay their sarcasm to their readers/listeners. Another fact that makes it difficult is the use of conversational and situation context, as well as, well, common sense and general knowledge of the world. This of course, makes teaching AI unique human linguistic traits just <em> wonderfully<em>. 

Both problems are a "Classification" problem. When given a piece of text as input, we want to guess if it is of sarcastic or humorous quality.
