### Thoughts

Github Pages, Jekyll, Hyde, and boom. Here we are. I never realized how easy it was to create a simple blog + theme and start ranting on about whatever is on my mind. Anyhow, this is my first attempt to start a blog.



As someone who is an absolute rockstar in CS, with an exemplary record of destroying competitons, writing multiple industrial level bug free code, i'll be describing about collecting annoted image description corpus for generation of rich face descriptions.



Just kidding.



Jokes aside, this blog will be mostly about simple, plain articles from your everyday layman's perspective on computer stuff. If your looking for a tangible guide on writing an autonomous car system using the cutting edge machine learning algorithms, you're probably at the wrong place.
