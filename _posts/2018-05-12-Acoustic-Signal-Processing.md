# Acoustic Signal Processing

## Signal Processing: Introduction

Signal processing refers to the acquisition, storage, display, and generation of signals â€“ also to the extraction of information from signals and the re-encoding of information. As such, signal processing in some form is an essential element in the practice of all aspects of acoustics. Signal processing algorithms enable acousticians to separate signals from noise, to perform automatic speech recognition, or to compress information for more efficient storage or transmission.
