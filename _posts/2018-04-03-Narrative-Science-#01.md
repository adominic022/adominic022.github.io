Narrative Science is an NLG (natural language generation) for automating work, primarly through their platform Quill. Located in Chicago Illinois, this small but powerful startup of hundred employees is one of many competent startups in AI. With 68% of companies using AI in their product and enterprise, it is no surprise that technologies such as NLG become increasingly important. Narrative Science is a company that focuses on Natural Language Generation, which is to produce meaningful text from raw computer data. Things such as customer service, reports, and bussiness insights can all be generated and automated through the use of AI and NLG. Popular customers of Narrative Science include: MasterCard,  Deloitte, USAA and etc. 


### Why Narrative Science is exciting for me


I remember my first exposure to AI and ML was watching AlphaGo beat Lee Sedol in a game of the century on cable. It seemed so surreal, intangible at the time. Then came sophmore year, I was in a Hackathon competition, where me and my team wrote an app, where the user could monitor his/her house door and the app could make intelligent decisions if a person is an intrudor or not. I scratched up the basics for the backend and app the itself, (this is the start of my hatred for any mobile/web programming) in Ionic (unfortunately), as i noticed my upper classmen teammate write the object detection code. I had no idea what he was writing, until we launched the prototype! It was a YOLO (you only look once) real time object detection, and i was amazed at this thing. Fast-forward a year, the only occasional chance I get to focus on Machine Learning is by reading research papers or luckily seeing some kind of news regarding ML. In that sense, I have neved thought about how people in the industry will adopt these technologies to apply them to everyday work and bussiness. And this is why Narrative Science really hits the mark. Reading an article about it on some ML reddit post, I decided to do more research on it and was delighted to learn a bit more about how they use NLG.

It is hard to find exact numbers and data on how profitable they are in the industry. They seemed to have raised quite the investment over the years, amassing roughly $43 million. Profit and other things such as revenue is hard to find the web, and even if they do exist, their sources seem questionable. Recent activities only seem to include their blog updates, with the most significant activity being their participation in "Gartner Data & Analytics Summit Grapevine". Previous news are mostly announcement of investors or partners. Competitors include Yseop, Automated Insights, SAS... the list goes on.


The interview process seemed straightforward: fill in form, with application and resume, which results either in an interview with a live coding session, or well, rejection. It's very interesting that Narrative Science are proud of their benefits, as it is depicted in great detail, just like their requirements list. Joking aside, Narrative Science boast a high quality work environment, with both great physical and mental benefits. I only wish that there was more information about how the company feels like, and how it runs. Thank you for reading.
