<h2 id="introduction-to">introduction to:</h2>

<p>I’m sure everyone’s heard of twitter right? Hilarious and outrageous Donald Trump tweets, people asking for a year of free chicken nuggets, all sorts of shenanigans. Based on San Francisco, twitter has become one of the most iconic social networking service alongside Facebook, Instagram, and Youtube. Twitter is pretty damn famous, and chances are, if you are able to see this article, you probably either use or have heard of it at some point.</p>

<p>Limited to only 140 characters, (which was doubled recently) users can post “tweets”, and other users can either retweet(share this), or like it. It is a massive company, ranking 21st on internet companies, with a revenue of $731 million dollars. Ok, I honestly have no idea how big that is, but you get the point. Twitter is one hell of a big company, with about 3000+ workers and more than 200 engineers.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--ilBkppfX--/c_scale,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/vbx1bzdxkjkipmic7olv.png" alt="placeholder" /></p>

<h2 id="why-twitter">Why Twitter?</h2>

<p>For the last company, I picked a massive company, because why the hell not? Who doesn’t want to work in one of the dream companies? But what makes Twitter more compelling is their Machine Learning team, named Cortex AI. Like most social networking services, their AI team focuses on specific important, relevant data for each user, looking to supply that usually through each users newsfeed. Or other small, helpful features that make user experience all that more seamless. For example, recently, Twitter has been training neural networks to identify and automatically crop picture previews to their most interesting part. Teaching a neural net saliency in an real life example is so much more interesting and fascinating than reading about it through a research paper. Mind you, I’m not trying to discredit all the papers or huge feats that the pioneers in the field take, but for me it really is the application of some of these technologies that completely astonish me.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“We believe in free expression and think every voice has the power to impact the world.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A lot more believable and honest statement after what Facebook has gone through with Mark Zuckerberg. Anyone can can agree that is probably true, if you have tried using Facebook. That doesn’t make one company better than the other, but it is a big change between competitors. This might result in a change in scene, but I doubt people will stop using Facebook altogether.</p>

<h2 id="misc">misc.</h2>

<p>Another interesting thing to note are AI chatbots. AI chatbots are starting to become common, as bot platforms embrace the new rise in AI technology. However, Microsoft released an interesting AI chatbot, that was basically a twitter bot. Basically, the more you talk to this chatbot, the smarter it becomes, learning to engage people through conversation. Unfortunately for MS, people sent the chatbot arrays of misogynistic, racist, Donald Trumpist remarks. The chatbot, being the AI is, began repeating these sentiments back, tweeting thousands of messages that were just, meh. And all of this is truly amusing, as its not like the bot had a coherent idealogy. This was all very interesting, and I’m sure to look into chat bots after this event.</p>

<h2 id="more-on-twitter">More on Twitter</h2>

<p>Twitter mostly makes revenue on advertisement, and probably will do just like most social networking services. Twitter is not in the top 20 IT companies, but ranks 15 on the internet companies, below Spotify and above Airbnb (ranked on revenue). To me, that is weird, as I would imagine for such a large company to rank higher. Anyway, I have heard many compliments and commendation about work environment and atmosphere from people who work there, and the general review is excellent.</p>

<p>Twitter has a multiple interview process, again applied through using a form and recieving an email to be qualified as a candidate. It offers a myriad amount of job options, not just developer or manager jobs, and it is very interesting to note that they have very specific names for some positions, with different locations available. Job requirements are long, not really surprising. Although internship opportunities are just as unlikely, we still have to try right?</p>
