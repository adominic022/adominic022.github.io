<p>Narrative Science is an NLG (natural language generation) for automating work, primarly through their platform Quill. Located in Chicago Illinois, this small but powerful startup of hundred employees is one of many competent startups in AI. With 68% of companies using AI in their product and enterprise, it is no surprise that technologies such as NLG become increasingly important.</p>

<p>Narrative Science is a company that focuses on Natural Language Generation, which is to produce meaningful text from raw computer data. Things such as customer service, reports, and bussiness insights can all be generated and automated through the use of AI and NLG. Popular customers of Narrative Science include: MasterCard,  Deloitte, USAA and etc.</p>

<h3 id="why-narrative-science-is-exciting-for-me">Why Narrative Science is exciting for me</h3>

<p>I remember my first exposure to AI and ML was watching AlphaGo beat Lee Sedol in a game of the century on cable. It seemed so surreal, intangible at the time. Then came sophmore year, I was in a Hackathon competition, where me and my team wrote an app, where the user could monitor his/her house door and the app could make intelligent decisions if a person is an intrudor or not. I scratched up the basics for the backend and app the itself, (this is the start of my hatred for any mobile/web programming) in Ionic (unfortunately), as i noticed my upper classmen teammate write the object detection code. I had no idea what he was writing, until we launched the prototype! It was a YOLO (you only look once) real time object detection, and I was amazed at this thing.</p>

<p>Fast-forward a year, the only occasional chance I get to focus on Machine Learning is by reading research papers or luckily seeing some kind of news regarding ML. In that sense, I have neved thought about how people in the industry will adopt these technologies to apply them to everyday work and bussiness. And this is why Narrative Science really hits the mark. Reading an article about it on some ML reddit post, I decided to do more research on it and was delighted to learn a bit more about how they use NLG.</p>

<p><img src="https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/11/28/2db80f03-76ba-11e4-b569-d4ae52e95e57/resize/770xauto/c93f325232ca51fcbbda629bd670ed31/narrativescienceflow.png" alt="placeholder" /></p>

<p>It is hard to find exact numbers and data on how profitable they are in the industry. They seemed to have raised quite the investment over the years, amassing roughly $43 million. Profit and other things such as revenue is hard to find the web, and even if they do exist, their sources seem questionable. Recent activities only seem to include their blog updates, with the most significant activity being their participation in “Gartner Data &amp; Analytics Summit Grapevine”. Previous news are mostly announcement of investors or partners. Competitors include Yseop, Automated Insights, SAS… the list goes on.</p>

<p>The interview process seemed straightforward: fill in form, with application and resume, which results either in an interview with a live coding session, or well, rejection. It’s very interesting that Narrative Science are proud of their benefits, as it is depicted in great detail, just like their requirements list. Joking aside, Narrative Science boast a high quality work environment, with both great physical and mental benefits. I only wish that there was more information about how the company feels like, and how it runs. Thank you for reading.</p>

<p>Ever started on a new topic of research and wondered where to start? Although the power of Google searches and forums/respositories such as Reddit and arXiv, the Information Age has presented us with a new problem: Too much information. Hundreds of tutorials, thousands of papers, all accessible online for free or a small amount of cash, it is so easy to get lost and lose track of things. Iris AI attempts to solve this problem, by creating an AI powered science assistant that personalizes in your field of interest and research. By visualizing your problem into a map of articles, it enables users to fine tune the results by using an editor for results. It is the ultimate tool to hunt down your perfect exact reading list.</p>

<p>Started at Singularity University at NASA Ames Research Park, and based primarily in Olso, Iris AI boasts a team of 20 multinationals. Their vision, according to their website:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Iris.ai is an Artificial Intelligence that starts out as a Science Assistant; helping you find the science you need. Over time she will learn, slowly but surely becoming a Scientist herself.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="why-i-picked-iris-ai">Why I picked Iris AI</h3>

<p>Personally, I picked Iris AI because I use it. Easy as that. A few months back, I stumbled on Iris AI by reading a blog post about it. They were tech superstars, who had recently raised roughtly $2 million to support themselves. Doubling revenue every quarter in 2017, and at customer capacity, this company has some solid Scandanavian investors. Anyway, I checked out their website, created an account, and went straight ahead to using Iris. You can start by either traning or exploring, using a paper url or TED talk that Iris will analyze. So far, I mostly use the explore feature, as I just need to calibrate and tweak Iris to look for what I’m interested on.</p>

<p>Most of my time is spent on Iris is reading the papers itself, or looking at each sub-categories, or, well, googling if there is an English version of this paper. It really saves up a lot of my time reading other blog posts, not that I don’t enjoy it or do it anyway, but for a newbie like me, not knowing where to look and start is quite discouraging. And haven’t we all fancied working for companies of products that we use on a daily basis? So there you go.</p>

<p><img src="https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/screen-shot-2016-11-29-at-2-57-03-pm.png?w=680" alt="placeholder" /></p>

<p>The interview process seemed straightforward: fill in form, with application and resume, which results either in an interview with a live coding session, or well, rejection. Iris AI, is primarily based on Oslo, but it seems that they have multiple locations where they base themselves. So either their team is split, or they work from home. It is not clear about what kind of benefits they have, but I’m sure with such a rockstar team, the benefits must be immense, or work environment must be amazing, or both.</p>

<p>They seem to have quite a number of open positions, but look for those who have a solid understanding of software coding, because most roles focus on designing software segments, planning, and then the implementation. At least, until they took the join page down. So I guess they aren’t looking for developers for now.</p>

      <h3 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h3>

<p>Github Pages, Jekyll, Hyde, and boom. Here we are. I never realized how easy it was to create a simple blog + theme and start ranting on about whatever is on my mind. Anyhow, this is my first attempt to start a blog.</p>

<p>As someone who is an absolute rockstar in CS, with an exemplary record of destroying competitons, writing multiple industrial level bug free code, i’ll be describing about collecting annoted image description corpus for generation of rich face descriptions.</p>

<h2 id="just-kidding">Just kidding.</h2>

<p>Jokes aside, this blog will be mostly about simple, plain articles from your everyday layman’s perspective on computer stuff. If your looking for a tangible guide on writing an autonomous car system using the cutting edge machine learning algorithms, you’re probably at the wrong place.</p>
