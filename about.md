### Hey!
<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm Simon, from Korea. Open-minded and getting the better out of my curiosity<br />
is what I'm all about. I like Computers! (well, kind of). Software Mostly. The 
part where I'm done and get to see the results. Honestly I have no idea what 
to write in a blog introduction, but hopefully this is fine. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm an avid linux+vim user, although linux is not a popular distribution in my
country. I mostly write code in C/C++/Python, hack some web/app stuff, but mostly
work projects in ML with Pytorch. NLP was a big thing for me, but I'm looking at 
other Deep Learning topics too.

### Rubber Duck
<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyone who has read the <i> Pragmatic Programmer</i> knows that it's
a reference to the rubber duck debugging, a method of debugging code. 
It's a method where you basically carry around a rubber duck and force yourself
to explain your code line by line, of course, to the duck. 
To be frank, grinding Valgrind, probing the numerous options on VS, wrestling
with grep/sed/awk on the terminal, turns out its one hell of a speech.
But it's always enough to keep me up all night, right?
