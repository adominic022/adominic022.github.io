### Greetings!

I'm Dongmin, from South Korea. Still an undergrad in Computer Science, with
a two years to go. I like Computers! Well, kind of. Software Mostly. The part
where I'm done and get to see the results. 

Honestly I have no idea what to write in a blog introduction, but hopefully
this is fine. 

I'm an avid linux user, although linux is not a popular distribution in my
country. I have mostly written code in C++, and a bit of machine learning in
Pytorch. 

I also have lots of other interests, like football (please don't call it
soccer), Jazz, and cooking. Not that i'm going to post about all those things,
but just sayin'.

### Rubber Duck

Yeah, anyone who has read the <i> Pragmatic Programmer</i> knows that it's
a reference to the rubber duck debugging, a method of debugging code. 
It's a method where you basically carry around a rubber duck and force yourself
to explain your code line by line, of course, to the duck. I started doing this
a while back, and it stuck. Of course I get weird stares from others in a cafe
or whatever, but what the hell.
